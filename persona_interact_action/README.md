This action is designed to enhance large language model (LLM) interactions by providing a structured prompt with role, history, and context elements. As a core interact action, it serves a critical role in shaping conversations and facilitating retrieval-augmented generation. Configured as a singleton, it ensures dedicated handling of interaction flow, requiring the Jivas library version 2.1.0 and depending on the `langchain_model_action` for comprehensive functionality.

Now supports streaming responses when the `streaming` flag is set on interact calls, enabling real-time output for improved user experience.
